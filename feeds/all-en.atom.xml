The Floppy Emu emulates a floppy disk drive. Floppy disk images can be stored on the SD card and mounted from the Floppy Emu itself. This makes it a lot easier to transfer and use software on the Mac and the Apple II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to use it with my Apple II computers and my olders Macs, most importantly, my &lt;a href="https://gtia.com/2020/01/30/i-now-have-128mb-of-ram-in-my-se-30-/"&gt;128MB Macintosh SE/30&lt;/a&gt;. Shipping was pretty fast, and after a quick flash to install the Macintosh Floppy Drive firmware, I was playing &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia&lt;/em&gt; on my SE/30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the full set up for $139, including the case and the SD card with Apple II and Mac software. The drive worked great. Unfortunately, in my haste, I dropped the Floppy Emu. Of course, I hadn't assembled the case. Well, the Floppy Emu came through with flying colors. The SD card did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Broken SD Card" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2020/BrokenSD-2020-02-22-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I assembled the case. It was a quick assembly, it took longer to get the adhesive paper off of the parts than it did to assemble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="So much paper" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2020/FloppyEmuAssembly-2020-02-22-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have a completed Floppy Emu! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Assembled Floppy Emu" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2020/FinishedFloppyEmu-2020-02-22-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next task is to start downloading software to play around with on my Mac. I think I'm going to set up two SD cards, one with Apple II software &amp;amp; the Apple II firmware, the other with Mac software &amp;amp; Mac firmware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use older Apple computers, the &lt;a href="https://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/"&gt;Floppy Emu&lt;/a&gt; is a must purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hardware"></category><category term="bmow"></category><category term="apple"></category><category term="mac"></category><category term="ii"></category></entry><entry><title>I now have 128MB of RAM in my SE/30!</title><link href="2020/01/30/i-now-have-128mb-of-ram-in-my-se-30-/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-30T20:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-30T20:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2020-01-30:2020/01/30/i-now-have-128mb-of-ram-in-my-se-30-/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I couldn't find my long handle T-15 Torx screwdriver, but it turns out I didn't have to.

Now that I have a [modem/ppp] device available, I want to upgrade to System 7.5. From what I've been able to find, I really need at least 16MB of RAM. Since RAM is pretty cheap, I went on eBay and bought 128MB of RAM in 8 16MB SIMMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a few searches, it looks like 16MB SIMMs became available around 1995 at $500 a piece, so, you're looking at $4,000 of RAM in 1995 ($6,800 in 2019 dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I'll get a chance to install it this week.

Today I tried it out as a modem. My first issue was the fact I didn't have any communication software on the SE/30. Well, I take that back. I did have something in Microsoft Works on the machine, but it's not, shall we say, full featured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some quick research, I came across &lt;a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/zterm"&gt;Zterm&lt;/a&gt;. Getting it to my SE/30 required the usage of another Mac. I downloaded the .sit file with my Windows machine and copied it to a floppy disk. The disk then went in my 20th Anniversary Mac. From there I uncompressed the sit file and put the resultant folder on a Mac formatted floppy. Finally, I took the floppy to my SE/30 and copied over Zterm 1.0.1. Originally I tried the 1.1beta version, but it wouldn't launch on my SE/30. I'm assuming it's something to do with System 7.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Zterm has been amazing. I switched the terminal emulation to VT100, and the only screen corruption issues I've had is when smart quotes or unicode is shown. That is to be expected. I can use tmux and Vim without issue. In fact, this article is being written with the SE/30 under Vim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a classic Mac online, then making a wifi modem and using Zterm is a pretty powerful combination. This set up does require some comfort at the command line so you can do stuff online.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hardware"></category><category term="mac"></category><category term="network"></category></entry><entry><title>Setting up a wifi modem with the CHIP computer</title><link href="2019/10/23/setting-up-a-wifi-modem-with-the-chip-computer/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-23T18:57:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-10-23T18:57:00-04:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-10-23:2019/10/23/setting-up-a-wifi-modem-with-the-chip-computer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was a backer of the original Kickstarter project for the $9 CHIP computer.

&lt;p&gt;My first project with the CHIP computers was setting up &lt;a href="https://github.com/juhovh/shairplay"&gt;Shairplay&lt;/a&gt; on one, and hooking it to a 1970s console stereo. The result is a pretty good sounding wireless speaker that I play music from my iPhone or iTunes on the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next project was to use a CHIP as a wifi modem for my retro computers. I wanted to use the CHIP instead of the Arduino based wifi modem for a couple of reasons. One, I have several CHIPs. Two, I wanted to be able to not only use the modem to connect to BBSes, but I also wanted to be able to ssh to hosts. Finally, I have a couple of old Macs (such as the SE/30) that do not have network cards. Using a CHIP as a PPP server I would be able to give these Macs (and my STs) an IP connections. With the modifications FozzTexx did to &lt;a href="https://github.com/FozzTexx/tcpser"&gt;tcpser&lt;/a&gt;, I would have a really cool wifi modem that could connect my retro computers to just about anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this article came from came from the hard work of &lt;a href="http://podsix.org/articles/pimodem/"&gt;Raspberry Pi modem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting the hardware ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re-flashed a CHIP, and started to look at how to add a serial port to the little guy. It has a built in UART, but then I would need some level-shifters to make it RS232 compatible. I took the easy way out and bought a FTDI based USB to RS232 cable. My cable arrived, but when I plugged it in... Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My kingdom for a driver&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, every Linux distribution under the sun has the FTDI serial driver, except for the CHIP computer with the 4.4.11 kernel. If you have the 4.4.13 kernel, you can skip these steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet led me to a defunct page on NTC's BBS in which someone had &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180919025028/https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/usb-serial-connection-from-chip-to-cnc-device-large-usb-port/11210/19"&gt;compiled the driver for the CHIP&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the link to the driver in Drobox was dead. But, all was not lost. I emailed the person who posted the driver, &lt;a href="https://github.com/danjperron"&gt;Daniel Perron&lt;/a&gt;, and as luck would have it, he still had a copy and sent it to me. It is now &lt;a href="https://cdn.gtia.com/2019/usbserial.tgz"&gt;posted on the internet&lt;/a&gt; for others! He was a big help, because the only other solution would be for me to set up and compile the driver, and I don't know if I could have done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had the driver, I followed the directions archived at &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180919025028/https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/usb-serial-connection-from-chip-to-cnc-device-large-usb-port/11210/19"&gt;archive.org&lt;/a&gt; and I then had a serial port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the CHIP (and as root), navigate to where the serial drivers will go and create a folder named serial there. Check the name of the kernel, if it is 4.4.13-ntc-mlc you are good to go and do not have to follow these directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ntc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;drivers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, copy the drivers from the download above into that folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert the modules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;insmod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usbserial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ko&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;insmod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ftdi_sio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ko&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now plugging in your FTDI device will give you a /dev/ttyUSB0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need to follow the directions in the &lt;a href="http://www.chip-community.org/index.php/Care_and_Feeding#Update_CHIP_Software"&gt;CHIP-Community wiki&lt;/a&gt; to update your apt sources so you can actually update the software on the chip and install software. In a nutshell, replace &lt;code&gt;ftp.us.debian.org&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;http.debian.net&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;archive.debian.org&lt;/code&gt;. Also, replace &lt;code&gt;opensource.nextthing.co&lt;/code&gt; with either &lt;code&gt;chip.jfpossibilities.com&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;chip.lotek.fr&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, since the apt sources are no longer being updated, we need to tell apt to ignore any expirations. &lt;code&gt;sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf&lt;/code&gt; and add the line (the fille will probably be blank and you will be creating it):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Acquire&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Check&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;Valid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Until&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now your apt commands will work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up tcpser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm using &lt;a href="https://github.com/FozzTexx/tcpser"&gt;FozzTexx's fork of tcpser&lt;/a&gt;. What tcpser does is provide modem emulation. After adding a USB to RS232 adapter (usually based on the FTDI chip), you can plug it into any computer with an RS232 port and tcpser will act like an Hayes compatible modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I had to set up the CHIP so I could get the tcpser source and compile it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sudo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;essential&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now I clone the git repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FozzTexx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tcpser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And finally, compile that bad boy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tcpser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A couple minutes later and I had a &lt;em&gt;tcpser&lt;/em&gt; executable in the directory. I'll move it somewhere sane later, I just wanted to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tcpser&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ttyUSB0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;19200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;amp;K0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;K0&lt;/code&gt; disables flow control, you may need it on, but it worked on my Atari 800 without issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a cable that consists mostly of dongles since I didn't have a 9-pin female to female adapter. The cable connected the CHIP to my MegaSTe as my first test. It worked right away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tcpser works exactly like a Hayes compatible modem would work. To dial, use &lt;code&gt;atd&lt;/code&gt; and the IP address of the host. To hang up, use &lt;code&gt;ath&lt;/code&gt;. Depending on your terminal program, you may be able add ip addresses and port numbers and dial out like the old days. If your terminal program can't handle ip addresses or domain names, you can pass an address book when &lt;a href="https://github.com/FozzTexx/tcpser"&gt;starting tcpser at the command line&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing this article in Vim on my Atari MegaSTe. At 9600 baud it is pretty responsive, except for when it comes time to scroll. My Vim setup is configured for writing, using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim"&gt;Goyo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown"&gt;vim-markdown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/reedes/vim-pencil"&gt;Pencil&lt;/a&gt; plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can dial out, but it would be nice to connect to the CHIP and then ssh out from there. To do that, install telnetd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to set up tcpser as a service, so it starts when the CHIP starts up. Right now I ssh into my CHIPs and run tcpser under tmux.

&lt;p&gt;This past September I had the opportunity to make it to my second Vintage ComputerFest - Midwest. It was a great opportunity to not only see a lot of great hardware and software, but to also hang out with others that are as passionate about retro computing as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past September I had the opportunity to make it to my second Vintage ComputerFest - Midwest. It was a great opportunity to not only see a lot of great hardware and software, but to also hang out with others that are as passionate about retro computing as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facility was a lot bigger this year, with three large ballrooms and a vendor area in the large hallway. My biggest complaint is the HVAC, two of the rooms were freezing while the third was barely comfortable. The PA was also a little annoying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Atari Forever!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Room B" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2019/RoomB-2019-10-01-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as I arrived after my 5 hour drive I headed straight to the bathroom. But, after that, it was time to hit the Atari area. And the Atari area did not disappoint. MoparStephen had brought in a ton of Goodies, including an Atari800 with Incognito, an Eclaire XL, an 1088XEL and the greatest Atari 8-bit computer to date, the 1088XLD. The 1088XEL and 1088XLD are MyTek's re-imagining of the Atari 8-bit computer's motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MoparStephen's table" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2019/MoparStephenAtari-2019-10-01-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slor was also there with a very impressive Atari display plus extras, with a couple of Tandy computers thrown in for good measure. I spent a lot of time play testing the new version of Atarinet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SCAT Atari user group had a nice set up, including some awesome sounding games and demos playing. There were also a smattering of Ataris through out the complex. I didn't do a count, but it appears that there were more Ataris setup than any other computer brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ben Heck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ben Heck's portable Atari 800" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2019/BenHeckPortable800-2019-10-01-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you following the maker or building scene, you've probably seen Ben Heck's creation. Well, he was at VCFMW, and set up with the Atari people. He was showing off some very cool things, but the coolest was his newest Atari 800 handheld. I had missed his video when he originally built it, but I'm kinda glad to have been surprised with it. The portable Atari 800 works very well, and very fun to play with. Hanging out with Ben Heck was really cool too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;David Murray (The 8-Bit Guy) and the Commander X16&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Me and the 8-bit guy" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2019/MeAndThe8BitGuy-2019-10-01-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the Atari area was the prototype of the Commander X16, the 8-bit guy's ultimate 8-bit computer. Even in this unfinished form the computer was pretty impressive, especially with what it was capable of at only 2MHz. I've already subscribed to his Youtube channel so I can keep abreast of Commander X16 updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I would have gotten a chance to talk to him more, but he was understandably very popular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Odds and ends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most surprising take away from VCFMW was the surprising lack of Apple II hardware. There were a couple of Apple IIs here and there, and a fully kitted IIgs, but nothing compared to what the Atari people were showing off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Full on Apple IIgs" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2019/IIgs-2019-10-01-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really good time, and I hope I get a chance to go next year. If I do get to go, I'm going to bring some things to show off. What, you may ask? I don't know yet... Maybe I'll finally complete a game I would like to show off. :-) Or, something Apple II related!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also &lt;a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/iR3Gd2Wb13TtUQqP6"&gt;took a bunch of photos and placed them up on Google Photos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hardware"></category><category term="vcfmw"></category><category term="retro"></category></entry><entry><title>My Atari collection posted on Reddit for fanboy week</title><link href="2019/09/27/my-atari-collection-posted-on-reddit-for-fanboy-week/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-27T20:06:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-27T20:06:00-04:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-09-27:2019/09/27/my-atari-collection-posted-on-reddit-for-fanboy-week/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/d7ycqg/my_atari_collection_for_fanboy_week/"&gt;picture of my Atari collection on Reddit for fanboy week&lt;/a&gt;.

For those that aren't familiar with the Atari 400, it shipped with a membrane keyboard. Although it was pretty good for being a membrane keyboard, it wasn't as good as a real keyboard. Companies came out with keyboard upgrade kits. The less expensive kits were simply keys with stickers that you placed on top of the membrane keyboard. The best bang for your buck was the B-Key keyboard, which replaced the entire keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My B-Key Atari 400" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2018/Atari400-blue-2018-12-07-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction didn't state the amount of memory in the 400, but I took a chance that whoever upgraded the keyboard would have upgraded the memory to 48K while the machine was disassembled. Unfortunately, that was not the case. This 400 only has the default 16K of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I ordered the &lt;a href="http://atariage.com/forums/topic/267042-new-hardware-atari-400-ram-card-4852-kb-external-os-rom/"&gt;48/52K upgrade card&lt;/a&gt; from tf_hh over at &lt;a href="http://atariage.com"&gt;AtariAge&lt;/a&gt;. At the time I was planning on using one of Bryan Edwards' UAV kits to add composite/s-video out. That was, until I started looking at the Super Color CPU card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="48/52K upgrade card" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2018/400ramcard-2018-12-07-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My Super Color CPU card came in today, and I'm super excited to upgrade my 400.&lt;/p&gt;

In the past I've taken a modded Xbox and a Raspberry Pi to family gatherings, but both of them require me to commandeer one of the TVs, which usually is another boss battle in and of itself. While trying to think of a solution, I spied my Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 11s, which was my laptop for several years until I replaced it with a Chromebook last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="RetroYoga" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2018/RetroYoga-2018-11-25-800x.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yoga has an 11" screen, i5, 8GB of ram and a 256GB SSD. On specs alone it blows the OG Xbox and Raspberry Pi out of the water. More importantly, it had its own screen in addition to HDMI out, which meant I could use it by itself or with a TV, depending on the family temperament. I just needed to get RetroPie installed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installing Ubuntu 18.04&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several distributions to choose from, and this particular machine ran MATE when I used it as a laptop. I decided to install Ubuntu 18.04, for really no reason in particular. If you're curious on how to install Ubuntu, search around, there is no shortage of installation directions and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step took less than 15 minutes. After the installation, I was pleasantly surprised that the wireless worked. In the past I had to download and compile the wifi driver, but now it worked out of the box!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up the default user as &lt;em&gt;retro&lt;/em&gt;, with a password of &lt;em&gt;retro&lt;/em&gt;, and automatic log in. This way anyone could start playing without bugging me about passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installing RetroPie&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed the &lt;a href="https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/Debian"&gt;instructions in the RetroPie wiki on installing RetroPie under Debian/Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. It was pretty straightforward, but took forever. This step took a few hours to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the games, I had already downloaded a RetroPie distribution for the Pi and put it on an SD card. I popped the SD card into the built in card reader and dragged the roms to their respective folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Creating a desktop icon&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muggles aren't going to want to start a terminal and type &lt;em&gt;emulationstation&lt;/em&gt; to start up RetroPie, so I created a desktop icon. From a terminal I typed &lt;code&gt;nano ~/Desktop/RetroPie.desktop&lt;/code&gt;. This launched the nano editor, in which I typed the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="code"&gt;&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Desktop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Terminal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;emulationstation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RetroPie&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Comment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Controllers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What fun is playing RetroPie from the keyboard? Not fun at all. I grabbed several controllers I already had and configured them in RetroPie. This included a couple of USB Xbox 360 controllers, and an Xbox One controller connected over USB, and an OG Xbox controller with a USB adapter. I couldn't get RetroPie to recognize my cheap OG Xbox knock off controllers, so I'll have to work on those at a later date. Since the Yoga only has two USB ports, I also grabbed an USB hub. This is only temporary because I would like to get a smaller USB travel hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Traveling case&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To carry the Yoga and controllers to its destination requires a milk crate. I'm going to be looking out for something a little more travel friendly, but this will work for now. The problem is the controllers. They are big and bulky. If I wanted to spend some money I could pick up some travel controllers, but I'm not going to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love a hardshell case which would let me put the Yoga in tablet mode and mount it in the lid while the case holds a wireless keyboard and the controllers, but that's not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;In Use&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The N64 emulator played Mario Kart 64 flawlessly, with no slowdowns or glitches. Almost all of the games that we played worked well, except for some of the arcade roms, such as Street Fighter II. I'll need to investigate further. One nice feature of using the Yoga is the ability to put the laptop into tablet mode and put it on the side for vertical games such as Frogger and Raiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Future modifications&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have Atari 8-bit computer functionality, or any retro computer functionality installed. To complete the set up, it would be nice to be able to play Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, and Amiga games. I also need to troubleshoot Street Fighter II.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hardware"></category><category term="retro"></category><category term="raspberrypi"></category><category term="retropie"></category></entry><entry><title>Using Github Issues for comments</title><link href="2018/11/24/using-github-issues-for-comments/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-24T16:47:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-11-24T16:47:00-05:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-11-24:2018/11/24/using-github-issues-for-comments/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For publishing this website, I use &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a static website generator.

&lt;h1&gt;Storing comments in Github Issues&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments are tricky because you need some sort of server in place somewhere to accept comments and a way to place them on the webpage. Utterances uses the Issues interface in Github to store the comments, and some Javascript on the webpage to show the comments or allow someone to comment. Unfortunately, this set up does require the commenter to have a Github account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Javascript is added to the posts, Utterances will show any comments to the current page, and will automatically create an issue for the current page if one doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll play with it and see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Software"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="comments"></category></entry><entry><title>Tandy Assembly was pretty awesome</title><link href="2018/11/11/tandy-assembly-was-pretty-awesome/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-11-11T19:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-11-11T19:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-11-11:2018/11/11/tandy-assembly-was-pretty-awesome/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Me and Stewart Cheifet" src="https://cdn.gtia.com/pics/2018/IMG_5811-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I attended my first TRS-80 convention, &lt;a href="http://www.tandyassembly.com"&gt;Tandy Assembly&lt;/a&gt;. The hour and 20 minute drive was a lot easier than the 5 hour drive to Chicago for the Midwest Computer Fest that I went to back in September. Looks like wrote up anything about that trip, I need to rectify that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My middle school had a TRS-80 Model I (or II, I can't really remember), which was the first computer I ever touched. The first computer I ever really used was a Color Computer 1 with Extended Basic. On a visit to my uncle's house I taught myself Basic over the course of a week. My uncle let me borrow it for awhile, but it wasn't mine. The next year I received an Atari 800XL with a disk drive, which meant that the CoCo 1 went back to my uncle. So even though I grew up with Atari computers, the TRS-80 computers still hold a special spot in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a brisk morning driving down to Springfield. I had the CoCoCrew Podcast on, trying to catch up and to put me in the right frame of mind. The convention was held at the Springfield Marriott, and was a really nice location. My only complaint was the lack of close food options, but that's minor in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The show&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked through the doors and paid my $10 for admittance. Down the hall, there were two rooms set up. One for tables with vendors and demonstrations, and the other for the speakers. The table room was filled with TRS-80s as far as the eye could see! The only TRS-80 computer that I didn't see was the MC-10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 10am, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Chronicles"&gt;Stewart Cheifet from Computer Chronicles&lt;/a&gt; spoke. He was very genuine and matter of fact, talking about the early days of Computer Chronicles, dealing with Silicon Valley people such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, and his friendship with Gary Kildall. I throughly enjoyed his talk, and was very glad the organizers were able to get him to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over in the vendor/demonstration room I had some fascinating talks. I talked to Mike (I think that was his name, I should have written it down) at Cloud9 and for my CoCo 3 I purchased a 512K RAM upgrade, RGB cable, and a Drivewire cable. Now I have no excuse not to play with my CoCo 3 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My longest talk was with Arno Puder with &lt;a href="https://retrostore.org"&gt;RetroStore&lt;/a&gt;. Arno and Sascha Haberling have created a brilliant device for the TRS-80 Model III. Using a WSP-32 board, the Model III is able to connect to the internet and download software, just like an app store. It was quite fascinating watching the Model III browse through the software available, download, and then run the software. Arno also gave a talk on the creation of the hardware. If you don't have a Model III, there is an emulator for Android that works really well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the TRS-80 Model 100 table I saw a peripheral that I didn't know existed. It was a &lt;a href="https://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/v10n12/89_Tandy_DiskVideo_Interfac.php"&gt;Disk/Video Interface&lt;/a&gt;, an external box that gave the Model 100 monitor output at 80 columns and a 5 1/4" disk drive. A vendor had a couple of them for $200, but "I faced temptation and did not bend".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Photos and materials&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put together a Google Photo album of all of the pictures I took that day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a Nec Multisync 1970VX VGA monitor for use on my older RGB computers (Atari ST/STE/Amiga/CoCo 3/800XL with VBXE). It works well with the Amiga.

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a Nec Multisync 1970VX VGA monitor for use on my older RGB computers (Atari ST/STE/Amiga/CoCo 3/800XL with VBXE). It works well with the Amiga. Unfortunately, I can't get it to show up with my Mega STe. I haven't tried it with any of my other STs, but I'm thinking that the cable may not be right. I ordered a cable from Best and will try it after it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen looks really good with the Amiga 500 though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year or so ago I purchased a Nec Accusync LCD 71V after reading it was compatible with the 15KHz refresh of these older computers. At the time I couldn't get a machine to work with it, so I assumed it wouldn't. Well, I tried it again and it worked with the Amiga. I have no idea what I was doing wrong before. I prefer the 1970VX though, since it is a 19" screen vs the 17" of the 71V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm beginning to miss CRTs. Hopefully, in the future, scan doublers and upscalers will take advantage of the higher resolution screens that are available, making the CRT discussion moot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hardware"></category><category term="amiga"></category><category term="monitor"></category><category term="vga"></category></entry><entry><title>Continuing playing around with the VT420</title><link href="2018/10/23/continuing-playing-around-with-the-vt420/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-23T19:53:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-10-23T19:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-10-23:2018/10/23/continuing-playing-around-with-the-vt420/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've got everything working pretty well, with only a few nagging

&lt;p&gt;Don't let the GW2k name fool you, this is a 15" Sony Trinitron monitor, capable of 1024x768 at 75Hz. It was a pretty sweet monitor back in 1994, and still is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the CRT, especially since I can adjust the screen to fill it up and the lower 640x400 resolution doesn't look as blocky as it does when using an LCD. I did try out a Dell 20" 4:3 LCD that I use with my retrocomputers, but it wouldn't expand out the image to fill the screen. The Gateway monitor looks sweet anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With everyone moving to LCDs, I wonder if I can find a VGA CRT that will sync with the Atari models...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hardware"></category></entry><entry><title>Trying to get a BBS running</title><link href="2016/01/18/trying-to-get-a-bbs-running/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-18T20:37:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-01-18T20:37:00-05:00</updated><author><name>mr.rcollins</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-01-18:2016/01/18/trying-to-get-a-bbs-running/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the last few days, I've attempted to get a BBS up and going on one of my 8-bits.

It waited patiently for years until I stumbled across a post on AtariAge about using the Xbox with emulators that piqued my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon firing up the Xbox, I was surprised that it was still functional. Well, sort of. It usually took a few tries to fire up. I installed a larger hard drive in it and grabbed AtariXLBox from &lt;a href="http://xport.xbox-scene.com/"&gt;Xport&lt;/a&gt; along with a bunch of A8 games in various formats. It was able to play all of them without a hitch. In fact, with the Xbox plugged into a CRT TV, it was pretty much indistinguishable from the real thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a big emulation person, I’d rather be playing on the real thing, but using an Xbox has it’s advantages. For one, I can easily take it places and play several systems on it (there are emulators for all of the major consoles and arcade). It doesn’t support the multi-joy adapter from what I’ve seen, but I should be able to set up the 3rd joypad to work as the third player in Dynakillers. Lastly, it does support saving the settings on a game-by-game basis which makes it easier to start games up without worrying about what hardware the game requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be relatively inexpensive to try out this route. An original Xbox usually goes for under $50 on eBay, but if you look at garage sales or Craigslist you can probably find it cheaper. You’ll need to do some research on how to mod the Xbox so you can run the emulators. This usually involves using certain games with certain save files that trick the Xbox into running unsigned code. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hardware"></category><category term="xbox"></category><category term="emulation"></category></entry><entry><title>Fired up my Colecovision Adam for the first time</title><link href="2014/05/12/fired-up-my-colecovision-adam-for-the-first-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-12T11:56:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-05-12T11:56:00-04:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-05-12:2014/05/12/fired-up-my-colecovision-adam-for-the-first-time/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At some time I picked up a Colecovision Adam (complete) with several books and datapacks.

I was disappointed Donkey Kong wasn't in the box, but Donkey Kong Jr. was. As I was cleaning and arranging my basement lab, I decided I had better at least try out the Colecovision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first turn it on, you are put into some sort of typewriter mode. I don't have a ribbon in the printer, and the print head didn't like being turned on. Eventually, the printer stopped jamming the print head to the side, and I could type in the typewriter. I then switched it to word processing mode. Unless I'm missing something, this mode was terrible. This came out the same year as AtariWriter was released, and it doesn't even have full screen editing. I would have hated to actually use this to word process. That is, unless I'm missing something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was to try out the data packs. They look like normal audio cassettes, but work like the tape back up drives I used to use at work. I put Donkey Kong into the unity, and hit the reset slider besides the cartridge port (luckily I had the manual :-). And there I was playing DK Jr! Unfortunately, while it looks good, it doesn't play very much like the original. The chomping creatures (I'm sure they have a name) move too slow. &lt;/p&gt;

I remember I bough it for the Spartados X cartridge and R-time 8, but didn't realize everything else that was in it. I found an XF551 case which apparently had a CSS 3.5" upgrade kit installed. After stealing a 3.5" drive mechanism from an old PC, I was able to format my first 3.5" disk on my trusty Atari 800XL! (Actually, it took me 4 tries to find a disk that would format. I was using an ST to format a disk first to make sure it wasn't the upgrade causing the formatting to fail.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don't know what I'm going to use floppy disks for, but it is still pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silly me, I've lost the code to my luggage and I'll need you to try to
crack it so I can get to my stuff! Although I can't remember the code, I
think it will look familiar as you guess. After you guess, I'll tell you
how many numbers are right and are in the correct place with the dark
pegs to the right of the code. Correct numbers but in the wrong place
will be &lt;strong&gt;O&lt;/strong&gt;s. Order of the pegs have no relationship to the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to Play&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll need a joystick plugged into joystick 1. After the game starts,
the screen will be blank for a few moments before show you the game
board. Use up or down on the joystick to select different numbers, and
the fire button to submit your guess. The game is over when you
correctly guess the code or have more than 10 tries. Pressing the fire
button will start the game over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Get the file&lt;/h1&gt;

I had a snow day today, so I am proud to announce GozMind. It's
basically a clone of Mastermind. Unfortunately, trying to fit it into 10
lines was tough. So tough that the code to guess consists of the built in
characters, *!@#$%&amp;amp;. After you enter your guess with the controller,
pressing the fire button will have the computer tell you how you did.
An * means you have the right character in the right place. An O means
that you have the right character, it's just in the wrong place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Program breakdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not really happy with how the code looks. It's quite a mess. Maybe
I'll go back and refactor, but for right now it works. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Line 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;DIM C$(14): Holds the characters for the code. It also holds a
 duplicate set in inverse. The inverse is used as a indicator for the
 active place for the player&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S$(4): The solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;G$(4): Player guess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O$(4): Temp for scoring player guess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A$(4): Holds how the player did with their guess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H$(1),D$(1),M$(1),B$(1): To save a character in the lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C$="!#$%&amp;amp;@INVERSE": The characters used for the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H$="*":D$=".":M$="O":B$=" ": Used to save characters in the solve
 procedure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y=1: What row are we working on&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite line of the program. To create a random code to
guess, the program randomly picks a number from 0 to 1295. Why 1295?
That is 5555 is base 6. We have 6 codes from which to select, so we
want to use base 6. Once a random number is selected, it is converted to
base 6. Since strings in Atari Basic start with one, we have to add one
to each character. Each digit is converted to a string and then place in
S$. The graphics mode is selected and GOZMIND is printed at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reads the joystick, and adjusts the variables related to the current
code and position. If statements are used to keep the values in range.
It adjusts the character in G$ depending on what the player has
selected. The repeat loop is waiting for a guess in all 4 slots and for
the player to push the button. Once satisfied, execute the SOLVE
procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prints how well the player did on the right side of the screen. It them
increments Y to go to the next row and checks to see if the player has
solved the puzzle yet or if the player has exhausted all 10 tries. If
the game has ended, wait until the player to press the button to start a
new game. Else, continue playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Converts the numbers in G$ to the characters to print on the screen. The
computer only deals with numbers, but we need to covert to characters
for the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Line 90 &amp;amp; 100 PROC SOLVE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toughest code to write. O$ is a copy of the solution, because we are
going to destroy the variable as we go. First it finds out which character selected
by the player is correct and in the correct place. The for loop goes
through each character of the solution, and checks for a match in the
players guess. If there is a correct guess, the current position of A$
is set to * and the position has one added. We then set that position in
O$ to a . and in the guess to space so it doesn't match any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code then goes through the solution one character at a time and
checks for the right character just in the wrong position. This time, if
there is a match, it is added as an O to A$.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Software"></category><category term="contest"></category><category term="tbxl"></category></entry><entry><title>Ready</title><link href="2014/01/13/ready/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-13T22:07:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-13T22:07:00-05:00</updated><author><name>gozar</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-01-13:2014/01/13/ready/</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Ready&lt;/h1&gt;
