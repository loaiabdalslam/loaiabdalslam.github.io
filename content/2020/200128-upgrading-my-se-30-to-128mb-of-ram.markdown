My trusty [Macintosh SE/30](TK) has had 5MB of RAM in it since I installed the SCSI2SD and System 7.1. Now that I have a [modem/ppp] device available, I want to upgrade to System 7.5. From what I've been able to find, I really need at least 16MB of RAM. Since RAM is pretty cheap, I went on eBay and bought 128MB of RAM in 8 16MB SIMMs.

I did a few searches, it looks like 16MB SIMMs became available around 1995 at $500 a piece, so, you're looking at $4,000 of RAM in 1995 ($6,800 in 2019 dollars).

Hopefully I'll get a chance to install it this week. Now, where did I put that Torx screwdriver...
