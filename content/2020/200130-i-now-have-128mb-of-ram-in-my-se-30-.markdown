Well, I couldn't find my long handle T-15 Torx screwdriver, but it turns out I didn't have to. Apparently, when I installed the SCSI2SD, I never put the screws back in by the handle. While that works in my favor now, I'm going to need to dig through my screws and find the ones that go in my SE/30. But I digress.

Behold, 128MB in my SE/30. Strange though, I don't have MODE32 installed and I thought the SE/30 wouldn't see more than 8MB of RAM. I guess I'll need to do some more research.

Now to install 7.5.5 and maybe A/UX. I don't know about the Unix, but since I have the drive space, I'm thinking it would be criminal NOT to install it.
