After seeing [Bill Kendrick's
Minijong](http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/atari/nomam2014/minijong/) I
knew I had to go back and re-work GozMind. I stole.. I mean, borrowed,
Bill's character redefinition ideas, and replaced the symbols with the
number 1-6. The result is **Crack My Luggage**.

# Introduction

Silly me, I've lost the code to my luggage and I'll need you to try to
crack it so I can get to my stuff! Although I can't remember the code, I
think it will look familiar as you guess. After you guess, I'll tell you
how many numbers are right and are in the correct place with the dark
pegs to the right of the code. Correct numbers but in the wrong place
will be **O**s. Order of the pegs have no relationship to the code.

# How to Play

You'll need a joystick plugged into joystick 1. After the game starts,
the screen will be blank for a few moments before show you the game
board. Use up or down on the joystick to select different numbers, and
the fire button to submit your guess. The game is over when you
correctly guess the code or have more than 10 tries. Pressing the fire
button will start the game over.
