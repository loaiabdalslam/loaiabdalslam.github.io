## About gtia.com

I registered the domain name with the pie-in-the-sky idea about using it for an online Atari magazine. The name comes from the graphics chip of the Atari 8-bit computer line.

Now, I use the domain and website for my own geek adventures. The site is published with [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/mrrcollins/gtia.com). 

It is amazing how much you can host for free now! Hit me up through [Github](https://github.com/mrrcollins) or [email](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJDmxy8kG33oTgdZVwbA8RrKICyhMBNTYYpjT_OikF8cZIfQ/viewform).
