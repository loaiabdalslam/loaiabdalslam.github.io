I've got everything working pretty well, with only a few nagging 
problems. The biggest is the screen corrupting of vim when running 
through tmux. The problem is there with screen also. If I use vim 
outside of tmux or screen, it works fine. Inside of tmux or screen? 
Problems. :-( Maybe it's a sign to not multitask when writing?

I've grown accustomed to using multiple programs at the command line, if 
I can't get vim to work, I guess I can use something like nano.

Ok, I switched to nano, and am using it within tmux. So far, so good, 
although I'm already missing the spell check as I type which I had set 
up in vim.

This will work for now.
