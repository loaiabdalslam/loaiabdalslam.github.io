After several hours of troubleshooting and beating on it, I'm proud to show off my successful installation of the VBXE along with an Ultimate 1M:

It feels weird using the 800XL on an VGA LCD screen, almost like I'm in emulation. To convert the VBXE output to VGA I'm using an GBS-8200 converter, which does a really good job of it. The monitor I'm using is a 15" Magnavox TV that is also a VGA monitor. It's nice because I can use the built in speakers for sound. I may start cruising eBay for another Dell 20" lcd though.
