After much troubleshooting, I now have VGA output from an 800XL!

The VBXE plugs into the 5 pin connector on the GBS-8200, which then goes out as VGA. Unfortunately, the Apple monitor doesn't have a VGA plug, so I have an adapter to convert it. Looks very good!

Now to install a Ultimate 1MB and the stereo upgrade...
