I'm pretty bummed. It's the last day of break and I didn't even get a chance to start [on my big project](http://gtia.com/2018/12/07/christmas-break-project-upgrading-my-b-key-atari-400-with-48-52k-of-ram-and-the-super-color-cpu-card/). Maybe I'll get a chance to finish it before next year....

On the other hand, I do have the parts now to build [an SDrive Max](https://github.com/kbr-net/sdrive-max). The SDrive Max is an Arduino base floppy disk and tape emulator that can be used with the Atari 8-bit computers.
